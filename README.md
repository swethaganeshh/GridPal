## 💭 What is GridPal?

**GridPal** is a lightweight **chat assistant** built to **onboard newcomers to the LUKSO blockchain**. Instead of navigating dense developer documentation, GridPal lets you ask questions conversationally—just like you would to a mentor or friend.

From setting up a **Universal Profile**, to understanding **The Grid**, **LSPs**, and **Web3 fundamentals**—GridPal is your buddy in this futuristic world.

## 💡 Why I Built This

When I first joined the LUKSO hackathon, **everything felt completely new**—Web3, Universal Profiles, The Grid, even how to use a wallet.

As a beginner:
- I **struggled to find beginner-friendly resources**.
- Most help was buried in technical developer docs.
- I wished for a **friend or chatbot** that could explain things clearly.

That’s how the idea for **GridPal** was born.  
A friendly **chat-based guide** to help users understand LUKSO concepts quickly and comfortably.

> Instead of reading long docs, just ask:  
> “How do I create a Universal Profile?”  
> “What is The Grid?”  
> “How do I connect my wallet?”
